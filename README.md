# Sway builds for Ubuntu 20.04

Ubuntu 20.04 build system for sway and related tools.

Even though most of these tools (including sway and wlroots) are now available in Ubuntu, they move and evolve pretty quickly and I personally prefer to keep up to date with those.

This repository contains a Makefile based build system for all of these. We are NOT building deb packages (see my [old repository which did](https://github.com/luispabon/sway-ubuntu-deb-build) if you want to do so), but we're directly building from source and installing as root.

This means you should make sure you do not install any of the ubuntu provided packages, and indeed dependents (for instance other tools that depend on wlroots) should also be compiled here.

Apps provided (make sure you do not install these via Ubuntu's package repos):

  * Sway
  * wlroots
  * clipman
  * kanshi
  * mako
  * swaylock-effects
  * waybar
  * wf-recorder
  * wofi
  * swayidle

Experimental:

  * Pipewire 0.3

Debs:

  * network-manager-gnom: supersedes Ubuntu focal's version, hides unmanaged interfaces (eg virtualbox, docker, etc)

# Prepare your system's environment

You must make sure that

```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
```

is set on your environment prior to starting Sway. This is required so that any apps you compile here can find each other's library, as they're placed somewhere else than Ubuntu's default library path.

# Note: `sudo`

Some operations require root to complete. While building `sudo` will be run at some point to do so and your password will be asked.

# Note: `meson` and `ninja`

Make sure you uninstall `meson` and `ninja` if you've already installed them via Ubuntu's package manager. We need newer versions than what's available in 20.04 and we'll be installing the latest versions using `pip` instead.

# Dependencies

You need `make`. That's it really, everything else can be installed via the provided targets in the [Makefile](Makefile).

# Building stuff

First time, you should probably run

```
make yolo
```

This will clone all the app's git repos, install dev dependencies and tools required to build everything, then it proceeds to build each project in sequence.

Have a look at the [Makefile](Makefile) for all the different build targets, in case you want to build this or the other app. I for instance build `wlroots` and `sway` once a week, for which I have

```
make core
```

## Updating repositories before building

Simply pass `-e UPDATE=true` to `make`:

```
make mako -e UPDATE=true
```

## App versions

At the top of the [Makefile](Makefile) you'll see one variable per app that defines which version of that app to build that you can override via environment. By version, I mean either a git hash, or a branch, or a tag - we will simply be running `git checkout $APP_VERSION` before building that app.

For instance, if I wanted to build wlroots `0.11.0`, sway `1.5` and swaylock-effects `master`, while making sure we're on the absolute latest commits for each:

```
make core swaylock-build -e SWAY_VERSION=1.5 -e WLROOTS_VERSION=0.11.0 -e UPDATE=true
```

Note the lack of `SWAYLOCK_VERSION` up there - `master` is already the default.

# Uninstalling stuff

When installing the stuff we're compiling, `ninja` will be copying the relevant files wherever they need to be in the system, without creating a `deb` package. Therefore, `apt autoremove app` won't work.

So far all the apps in the repo except for clipman use `meson` and `ninja` for building. As long as you don't delete the `APP/build` repository you can uninstall from the system anything ninja installs:

```
cd APP
sudo ninja -C build uninstall
```

If you deleted the `build` folder on the app, simply build the app again before running the command above.

# wlroots dependencies

This goes without saying, but if you're updating `wlroots` make sure it's built first so that any of the other apps that link against it (like `sway`) have the right version to link against instead of linking against the version you're replacing.

# Experimental apps

These are not included in the `yolo` target. These are apps I've put in there to try stuff but that I don't necessarily know if they'll break something down the line. For instance, `pipewire` (needed for screen sharing against `xdg-desktop-portal`) is not yet a thing in Ubuntu and should be alright, but it is a system dependency other apps might have dependencies on (Firefox might come in the future with it, or chrome, or require the system's version).
